# odin-recipes
Following TOP (The Odin Project), I will create a recipe book to bolster my html, css, and eventually javascript skills. The hope is that by the time it is finished I will be able to create a sleek, modern looking website, reactive to my own phone and pc, without wasting too much time googling.
