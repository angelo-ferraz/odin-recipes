            <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for the baking sheet</li>
            <li>75g plain flour</li>
            <li>1 tbsp paprika</li>
            <li>200g low-fat natural yogurt</li>
            <li>265g cauliflower florets</li>
            <li>25-50ml hot sauce</li>
            <li>2 tsp honey</li>
            <li>1 lime, zested and juiced</li>
            <li>150g salad leaves</li>
            <li>250g cooked lentils</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Heat the oven to 220C. Oil and line a baking sheet with non-stick baking parchment. Put the flour, paprika and a big pinch of salt in a bowl and whisk in the yogurt and 50ml water until you have a smooth batter. Toss in the cauliflower florets until coated and spread out in an even layer on the baking sheet.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Bake for 20-25 mins, tossing halfway through, until crisp and golden. Put the hot sauce and 1 tsp of the honey in a pan to heat up, toss the cauliflower in the mixture, put back on the tray and cook for about 5-8 mins more.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Meanwhile, whisk together most of the lime zest and all the juice, the remaining 1 tsp honey and 1 tbsp olive oil in a large bowl, and toss in the salad leaves and lentils. Divide between two plates and top with the cauliflower wings and the remaining lime zest, if you like.</p>
